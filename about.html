                    <p>My name is Puneet Pawar. I live in Sacramento, California and I am on a quest to find answers and solve problems using data, just because it's fun! :).   </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Self-driven</mark> Leaving my decade long career as a Product Development Engineer to pursue my interest in Data Science took a lot of courage and planning. I did it and I realized that I am pretty good at doing new things (thanks to all the SCRUM meetings for years - painful but teaches effective planning and execution :D). So, next stop - Excellence in Data Science.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Meticulous</mark> I really enjoy getting into the details of everything, it makes the time stop for me (well, only subjectively...). Then I remind myself that it hasn't actually stopped for the rest of the world, and I pull myself back on track to get things done. Once I have that time machine, there is no stopping me from spiralling into the depth of everything!</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Optimizer</mark> I love optimizing and organizing. I optimize learning new things by accompanying it with small hands-on projects. And my husband and I have optimized our cooking to the point that we can make a fairly complex meals from scrach in 40min and we don't have leftovers since COVID. All the ingredients and their quantities of our favorite recipes are organized in a tables and lists. It helps us make the exact quantity we want, no wastage. </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Nonconformist</mark> I am almost non-existent on social media. My best friend persuaded me to create an Instagram account so that I can see her updates. I am ok with being the only one on the planet doing or not doing something. </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Minimalist</mark> "Do we *need* this?" is my favorite question whenever my husband and I find something really pretty and tempting. It works well as a filter. And on rare occasions, even when the answer is 'no', we still end up buying it just because we absolutely love it :P, which is usually followed by donating the similar thing we already have. Decluttering is my other favorite thing!  </p>
                    <p class="small">I live with my lovely husband and 50+ plants. I love yoga, backpacking, camping and pretty much anything that brings me close to nature.</p>
