                <blockquote class = "about">
                    <p>My name is Puneet Pawar. I live in Sacramento, California and I am on a quest to find answers and solve problems using data, just because it's fun! :).   </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Self-driven</mark> Leaving my decade long career as a Product Development Engineer to pursue my interest in Data Science took a lot of courage and planning. I did it and I realized that I am pretty good at doing new things (thanks to all the SCRUM meetings for years - painful but teaches effective planning and execution :D). So, next stop - Excellence in Data Science.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Meticulous</mark> I enjoy diving into the fine print and I savor it with curiosity. I am that person who doesn't buy anything without first scanning the product label to see the ingredients list and making sure I understand how good or bad it is.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Optimizer</mark> I love optimizing and organizing. I optimize learning new things by accompanying it with small hands-on projects. And my husband and I have optimized our cooking to the point that we can make a fairly complex meals from scrach in 40min and we don't have leftovers since COVID. All the ingredients and their quantities of our favorite recipes are organized in a tables and lists. It helps us make the exact quantity we want without any wastage. </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Nonconformist</mark> I am almost non-existent on social media. My best friend persuaded me to create an Instagram account so that I can see her updates. I am ok with being the only one on the planet doing or not doing something. </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Minimalist</mark> "Do we *need* this?" is my favorite question whenever my husband and I find something really pretty and tempting. It works well as a filter. And on rare occasions, even when the answer is 'no', we still end up buying it just because we absolutely love it :P, which is usually followed by donating the similar thing we already have. Decluttering is my other favorite thing!  </p>
                    <p class="small">I live with my lovely husband and our plants. I love yoga, backpacking, camping and pretty much anything that brings me close to nature.</p>

                <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Born</mark> with a love for mathematics, inherited from my dad. Some of my favorite childhood memories with him are waking up at 4am to work on math problems.</p>
                <p class="small">I was about <mark class="highlight">10 years old</mark>, when I got inspired by my older cousin to pursue Engineering. So after completing high school, I ended up pursuing <mark class="highlight">Bachelor's degree</mark> in Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
                <p class="small">I wanted to learn more about how things work, so I pursued a <mark class="highlight">Master's degree</mark> in Embedded Electrical and Computer Systems with a focus on VLSI Design.</p>
                <p class="small">After my Master's, I worked as a <mark class="highlight">Product Development Engineer</mark> for 10 years, where I designed and developed products for the semiconductor industry. I was involved in all aspects of product development, from concept to production.</p>
                <p class="small">During my time as a Product Development Engineer, <mark class="highlight">data analysis</mark> became an integral part of my work. I used data to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and improve product performance. This experience sparked my interest in data science and analytics.</p>
                <p class="small">In 2024, I decided to transition into a data-focused role and enrolled in <mark class="highlight">data science and machine learning</mark> bootcamps to formalize my skills. I am excited to leverage my engineering background and data analysis experience in this new chapter of my career.</p>
