                <blockquote class = "about">
                    <p>My name is Puneet Pawar and I am passionate about leveraging the power of AI and ML for hardware design, validation workflows, silicon validation, failure analysis, and system integration. </p>
                    <p>This quote by Richard Hamming is an inspiration -  “The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.”</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Self-driven</mark> Taking a career break for professional development to fully commit to formalize my data science, AI and ML skills took a lot of courage and planning. I enrolled in intensive DS/ML programs and exceuted this well (thanks to all the SCRUM meetings for years). So here I am - a Semiconductor Product Engineer armed with AI and ML skills.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Meticulous</mark> I enjoy diving into the fine print and I savor it with curiosity. I am that person who doesn't buy anything without first scanning the product label to see the ingredients list and making sure I understand how good or bad it is.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Optimizer</mark> I love optimizing and organizing. I optimize learning new things by accompanying it with small hands-on projects. While working on data science projects, I noticed repetitive tasks and decided to automate them. I created a Python library of utility functions and i have hosted it publicly on <a href="https://github.com/pawarpuneet/PP_utils ">GitHub</a> for anyone to use.</p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Nonconformist</mark> I am almost non-existent on social media. My best friend persuaded me to create an Instagram account so that I can see her updates. I am ok with being the only one on the planet doing or not doing something. </p>
                    <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Minimalist</mark> "Do I *need* this?" is my favorite question whenever I find something really pretty and tempting. It works well as a filter. And on rare occasions, even when the answer is 'no', I still end up getting it just because I absolutely love it :P, which is usually followed by donating the similar thing I already have. Decluttering is my other favorite thing!  </p>
                    <p class="small">I live with my lovely husband and our plants. I love yoga, backpacking, camping and pretty much anything that brings me close to nature.</p>

                <p class="small"><mark class="highlight">Born</mark> with a love for mathematics, inherited from my dad. Some of my favorite childhood memories with him are waking up at 4am to work on math problems.</p>
                <p class="small">I was about <mark class="highlight">10 years old</mark>, when I got inspired by my older cousin to pursue Engineering. So after completing high school, I ended up pursuing <mark class="highlight">Bachelor's degree</mark> in Electronics and Communication Engineering.</p>
                <p class="small">I wanted to learn more about how things work, so I pursued a <mark class="highlight">Master's degree</mark> in Embedded Electrical and Computer Systems with a focus on VLSI Design.</p>
                <p class="small">After my Master's, I joined Intel Corporation and have worked as a <mark class="highlight">Product Development Engineer</mark>, where I developed semiconductor products with a wide breadth of experience across circuit design, validation, modelling, simulations, silicon debug, failure analysis, defining the post silicon test plans, data analysis and High Volume Manufacturing. Gained hands on experience with Multimeters, Oscilloscope, Logic Analyzer, Wafer prober and Automated Test Equipment.</p>
                <p class="small">During this time, <mark class="highlight">test automation and data analytics</mark> became an integral part of my work. I used data to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and improve product performance. This experience sparked my interest in AI, ML and thier applications in optimizing electrical engineering workflows.</p>
                <p class="small">In 2024, I decided to formalize my <mark class="highlight">AI and ML skills</mark> and enrolled in intensive training programs and hands on project work. I am now looking forward to meaningfully contribute to the next generation of AI driven semiconductor development. </p>

                <p class="small">I love solving puzzles, pattern recognition and spatial reasoning, one of the reasons why I find solving problems with data to be fun! It's like solving a puzzle, you put all the pieces together to reveal the bigger picture.</p>
                <p class="small">I love learning, so when i was looking for a platform to showcase my portfolio and data science projects, I learnt HTML/CSS and built this website.</p>
